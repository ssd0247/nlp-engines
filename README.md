### NLP-ENGINES - A collection of NLP processors

* Data exist in many modalities in the digital world.

* There lies humungous amounts of textual data in different formats, waiting to be popped open and analyzed.

* This repo aims to provide easy-to-use, pluggable scripts for undertaking tasks involving:

    - Natural Language Understanding (NLU); Understanding the syntax, semantics, and rules of a particular language. How words are connected together to make sentences and whole paragraphs to elucidate and convey the underlying idea. 

    - Natural Language Generation (NLG); How can we predict any target word, given a certain context.

    - Neural Machine Translation; Using neural networks to learn the concise, intermediate representation of the original text, more the task related information encoded in it, higher the bar for which the decoder can be trained.
